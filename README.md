# Welcome here

This is my directory where i stock my projects , i will detail these projects here

## Myfirstdb

It was a project based on making a database by getting data from an API and convert it into a Mongodb collection.
So the goal was to take all countries from the API.
The first step was creating a collection fom the JSON containing this data.
The next step was to take all the data from the collection created and create a new collection for each country.
Finally, the last step was to rank those into region and subregion collections.

## Api Express

This is a project where the goal is to make a application in Node Js.
The application will do :
- Get data on a road 

## Async/Await

This is a mini-project where the goal is to make a mini application in Node JS in order to train myself with the async / await method.
So the goal is to write some data from an API to a document using a JSON format 
For starters, I have 5 countries in a JSON Document and in the end I need to take all the data from these countries and write them on a new JSON document.
You can see the results in index.js

Thank you for reading

# Async/Await

## Welcome here
This is a mini-project where the goal is to make a mini application in Node JS in order to train myself with the async / await method.
So the goal is to write some data from an API to a document using a JSON format 
For starters, I have 5 countries in a JSON Document and in the end I need to take all the data from these countries and write them on a new JSON document.
You can see the results in index.js

Thank you for reading
